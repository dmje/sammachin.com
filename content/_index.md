# Welcome

Welcome to my site, 
this is intended to be a mixture of professional and personal stuff, 
I'm occasionally writing some of my thoughts  and I'm trying to document many of the things I build.


I am currently employed full time at [FlowForge Inc.](https://flowforge.com/) as Community Product Manager, my role is to work with the [Node-RED](https://node-red.org) community to improve both the open source and commercial products .
