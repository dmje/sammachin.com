Last week I went to [DroidCon](http://www.droidcon.co.uk) in [London](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=52+Upper+Street,+Islington,+London,+N1+0QH+&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=20.403926,39.506836&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=52+Upper+St,+London+N1+0QH,+United+Kingdom&z=16), as I had an early start and I got the venue with half an hour to spare I had breakfast at the [Breakfast Club](http://www.thebreakfastclubcafes.com/) Cafe in [Angel](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=31+Camden+Passage+N1+8EA&sll=51.526722,-0.081689&sspn=0.004452,0.015171&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=31+Camden+Passage,+London+N1+8EA,+United+Kingdom&ll=51.534617,-0.104907&spn=0.004451,0.015171&z=17), unfortunately our expense system only allows 50 characters in the description field when claiming expenses which I hardly think does this experience justice (nor can I claim to be embracing the spirit of Sarbanes-Oxley) therefore I'm writing a post which I can shorten with bit.ly  then link to from our expenses system.

I had pancackes [![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5135521630_2c2b551bcd.jpg)

I also had a latte  [![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1080/5135536928_0c7f9931f1.jpg)

I'm not claiming for the coffee as that would put me over policy £6.00 even though I dont think this is an excessive amount of food for a human male on a cold winters morning (let me know if you agree in the comments)

I also had an apple juice but as this is part of my 5-a-day and the government mandated it I'm clearly getting far more benefit from this than the company would so I won't claim for that either. Sorry I didn't get a photo of this as it didn't look that appetising, therefore it must have been healthy.

Here's a picture  of my receipt [![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5134985553_5ca7994d83_t.jpg)
](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sammachin/5134985553/) with the items I'm paying for out of my own pocket clearly crossed through, you'd think that a large technology focussed company would be able to do without paper but in a couple of days the electronic system will tell me to print out my claim and put it in an envelope along with theses scraps of paper and send it to a real person.
