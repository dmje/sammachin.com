**Spock**: Captain, Klingon Bird of Prey de-cloaking off the port side
**Kirk**: Mr Sulu, ready photon torpedos
**Sulu**: Captain, there's a problem,
**Kirk**: What Mr Sulu?
**Sulu**: Well during our last refit the torpedos were upgraded to the mk. 7 models,
**Kirk**:Â Yes yes man,
**Sulu**: Well I don't have the mk. 7 launcher client installed on my console,
**Kirk**: Well install it now man, that Klingon ship is about to blow us to oblivion.
**Sulu**: Its not that simple captain, I no longer have admin rights,
**Kirk**: So how are you meant to get it then?
**Sulu**: Well now I have to raise a software asset request to Starfleet IT
**Kirk**: How long will that take?
**Sulu**: Well sir we're well out of comms range of a Starfleet Admiral with the appropriate approval rights,
**Kirk**: Well just tell IT its an emergency and we'll get the approval when we return to space dock
**Sulu**: I don't think that will help captain.
**Kirk**: Why Sulu?
**Sulu**: They outsourced the software installation work to a colony on Bringloid V they still have a 4 year SLA....
**Kirk**: What the......
**Sulu**: The good news is that one year on Bringloid V is only about 18 earth hours, so we should be able to get an emergency change raised in about 3 days....
