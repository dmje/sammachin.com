Back in January at CES 2014 the organisers added a feature to the event app whereby you could unlock badges in the app by visiting different areas of the show floor and unlocking the badges by your phone detecting an iBeacon, I managed to write a simple hack to spoof these iBeacons from my MacBook therefore unlocking all the badges without leaving home :)

The code was a short bit of node that I've published at a [GIST](https://gist.github.com/sammachin/8298386)
