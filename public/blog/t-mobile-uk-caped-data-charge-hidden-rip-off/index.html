    <p>I recently managed to get my wife to become a regular user of mobile data, great I thought this stuff is finally getting mainstream traction, Until we got this months bill&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>She&rsquo;s got her gmail setup on her phone and occasionally will Google for something but certainly nothing that would say she was a regular user. Until I setup Google <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/latitude/intro.html">Latitude</a> It works really well for us as we car-share so she can use it to check if I&rsquo;ve left the office and am on my way to pick her up so she doesn&rsquo;t waste time waiting for me. I found it great when she was working late as I could see when she&rsquo;s left and get dinner on.</p>
<p>All was working well and I  actually managed to get her to leave it running 24x7 in the background, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry I said it hardly uses and amount of data and besides TMobile have their £1 per day cap so it can&rsquo;t cost you that much&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just for running latitude in the background they wanted nearly 20 quid from her! The immediate reaction was &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tuning it off, I don&rsquo;t want to use any data services ever again&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I though, this can&rsquo;t be right something must have gone wrong, first I checked if she&rsquo;d used anything else on her phone, no just latitude. OK maybe something&rsquo;s gone wrong with the application and its stuck in a loop eating up data. So I started to look at the itemization, now this has taken me several attempts over the weekend to understand and it was only with the help of a couple of colleagues that we finally managed to understand the bill (mostly)<a href="http://mogotion.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-3.png">
</a></p>
<p>OK, where to start with this, well firstly the data size column quotes 3values separated by colons whereas the actual data is 4 fields separated by a dot. At first it looked like she was getting through 135mb a day, blimey that must have hit the battery! however with a bit of reverse calculations on the pricing it turns out to be about 135k a day.  Those 4 fields are Gigabytes.Megabytes.Kilobytes.Bytes I&rsquo;m not sure if they count a meg as 1000k or 1024k but lets not argue,  how on earth can 135k a day run up £20 in a month?</p>
<p>Well here&rsquo;s the kicker, T-Mobile&rsquo;s standard data rate is a whopping £7.47 per MB (actually advertised at 0.73p/killoByte) yep that&rsquo;s right, of course most people don&rsquo;t see that as there is a cap at £1 per day, Now this works out OK if you use a fair amount of data, doing things like downloading a few meg of email and browsing a couple of web pages, however if you run a low volume constant background service you get screwed, the £1 day cap would  mean that you only pay for the first 136k of data. Just over latitudes typical usage,however if you only use under that 136k a  day you pay dearly</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to give Tmobile the benefit of the doubt here and that this is a well intentioned tariff to avoid bill shock and yes I guess latitude isn&rsquo;t a typical service (yet!) however it just goes to show how you can&rsquo;t rely on a time or volume based charging model and keep happy customers, to a customer the value isn;t in the amount of data or in how long they&rsquo;ve been running it the value is in the content and £20 is a lot to pay just so that you husband can get the dinner on the table!</p>
<p>Had the cap not been in place and it was just a standard £1/mb the bill would have only been £3.50 which is a far more reasonable amount. The guy in the TMobile store simply said &quot; Oh you can get a data bundle&quot; but it seems a little excessive to pay £7.50 for 1Gb of data to only use 0.3% of that. I don&rsquo;t really know what the answer is here but I think this is just another example of a charging model that doesn&rsquo;t quite work!</p>
<p>If anyone would from TMobile reads this and wants to get in touch leave a comment or message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/sammachin">twitter</a>, I&rsquo;d love to get this sorted and restore my wife&rsquo;s faith on mobile data</p>
