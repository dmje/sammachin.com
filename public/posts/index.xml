      <description>The Echo Show is the first Alexa enabled device from Amazon with a screen, with this device Amazon introduced some new capabilities within the Sklls SDK particularly around video, one of these is the ability to view home security cameras such as the Nest and the Ring Doorbell using the command &amp;ldquo;Alexa show X camera&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Lots of people are getting excited about one of the features of the new iPad Air 2 - The Apple Sim, its being pitched as a single sim card that allows you to switch carriers as you please, I suspect that under the hood its a special kind of multi profile sim card that actually contains profiles for each carrier, or possibly even allows new profiles to be loaded over the air.</description>

      <description>For quite a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking, talking and hacking away on something I&amp;rsquo;m calling The Talk Project, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail about that here, you can read some more on the sites own page, and I&amp;rsquo;m intending to add a lot more to that site in the coming months.</description>

      <description>For a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that telecoms and banking/payments are pretty similar industries when it comes to technology, both handle massive amounts of real time transactional data, making a payment in a shop using a visa card is fairly similar to the idea of sending someone an SMS when you strip it back, of course payments have to have higher levels of security than telecoms but we&amp;rsquo;re in the same ballpark.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough over the past few weeks to trial Three&amp;rsquo;s InTouch app, which allows you to make and receive calls and SMS on your phone over WiFi, ideal for times when you don&amp;rsquo;t have coverage.</description>

      <description>Back in January at CES 2014 the organisers added a feature to the event app whereby you could unlock badges in the app by visiting different areas of the show floor and unlocking the badges by your phone detecting an iBeacon, I managed to write a simple hack to spoof these iBeacons from my MacBook therefore unlocking all the badges without leaving home :)</description>

      <description>Ever since we moved into our house over 7 years ago now we&amp;rsquo;ve had a real problem with phone spam on the home number, we took over the same number as the lady who lived here previously as it was the fastest way to get a connection so that I could order ADSL on the line, I think I got it to 4-5days after we moved in :)</description>

      <description>A few months back there was a serious possibility that we were going to have to move house as a result of my wifes&#39; job, she&amp;rsquo;s an A&amp;amp;E Doctor and I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with the details but the way that medical recrutment works is its all done on regions and you get allocated/offered a job in a certain region, this will then usually consist of &amp;lsquo;rotating&amp;rsquo; around 5-6 (or more) hospitals every 6-12 months.</description>

      <description>Over the easter weekend I was looking for an idea of something to build, somehow I came up with the idea that it would be kind of cool to be able to make &amp;lsquo;announcements&amp;rsquo; around my house when I&amp;rsquo;m not there, not really sure why but I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some use case for this when combined with a home security webcam or maybe I can just talk to the cats.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to DroidCon in London, as I had an early start and I got the venue with half an hour to spare I had breakfast at the Breakfast Club Cafe in Angel, unfortunately our expense system only allows 50 characters in the description field when claiming expenses which I hardly think does this experience justice (nor can I claim to be embracing the spirit of Sarbanes-Oxley) therefore I&amp;rsquo;m writing a post which I can shorten with bit.</description>
